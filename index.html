<h2>Psalm 148</h2>
<p>Praise Yah!</p>
<p>Praise Yahweh from the heavens!</p>
<p>Praise him in the heights!</p>
<p>Praise him, all his angels!</p>
<p>Praise him, all his army!</p>
<p>Praise him, sun and moon!</p>
<p>Praise him, all you shining stars!</p>
<p>Praise him, you heavens of heavens,</p>
<p>you waters that are above the heavens.</p>
<p>Let them praise Yahweh’s name,</p>
<p>for he commanded, and they were created.</p>
<p>He has also established them forever and ever.</p>
<p>He has made a decree which will not pass away.</p>
<p>Praise Yahweh from the earth,</p>
<p>you great sea creatures, and all depths,</p>
<p>lightning and hail, snow and clouds,</p>
<p>stormy wind, fulfilling his word,</p>
<p>mountains and all hills,</p>
<p>fruit trees and all cedars,</p>
<p>wild animals and all livestock,</p>
<p>small creatures and flying birds,</p>
<p>kings of the earth and all peoples,</p>
<p>princes and all judges of the earth,</p>
<p>both young men and maidens,</p>
<p>old men and children.</p>
<p>Let them praise Yahweh’s name,</p>
<p>for his name alone is exalted.</p>
<p>His glory is above the earth and the heavens.</p>
<p>He has lifted up the horn of his people,</p>
<p>the praise of all his saints,</p>
<p>even of the children of Israel,</p>
<p>a people near to him.</p>
<p>Praise Yah!</p>

<h2>Psalm 149</h2>
<p>Praise Yahweh!</p>
<p>Sing to Yahweh a new song,</p>
<p>his praise in the assembly of the saints.</p>
<p>Let Israel rejoice in him who made them.</p>
<p>Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.</p>
<p>Let them praise his name in the dance!</p>
<p>Let them sing praises to him</p>
<p>with tambourine and harp!</p>
<p>For Yahweh takes pleasure in his people.</p>
<p>He crowns the humble with salvation.</p>
<p>Let the saints rejoice in honor.</p>
<p>Let them sing for joy on their beds.</p>
<p>May the high praises of God be in their mouths,</p>
<p>and a two-edged sword in their hand,</p>
<p>to execute vengeance on the nations,</p>
<p>and punishments on the peoples;</p>
<p>to bind their kings with chains,</p>
<p>and their nobles with fetters of iron;</p>
<p>to execute on them the written judgment.</p>
<p>All his saints have this honor.</p>
<p>Praise Yah!</p>

<h2>Psalm 150</h2>
<p>Praise Yah!</p>
<p>Praise God in his sanctuary!</p>
<p>Praise him in his heavens for his acts of power!</p>
<p>Praise him for his mighty acts!</p>
<p>Praise him according to his excellent greatness!</p>
<p>Praise him with the sounding of the trumpet!</p>
<p>Praise him with harp and lyre!</p>
<p>Praise him with tambourine and dancing!</p>
<p>Praise him with stringed instruments and flute!</p>
<p>Praise him with loud cymbals!</p>
<p>Praise him with resounding cymbals!</p>
<p>Let everything that has breath praise Yah!</p>
<p>Praise Yah!</p>

<h2>Luke 19:40</h2>
<p>Jesus answered them,</p>
<p>“I tell you that if these were silent,</p>
<p>the stones would cry out.”</p>
